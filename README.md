# Non-stationary-Markov-Model
Learning Multiple Transition models in your Markov Sequence

File fully_obs.m contains the description of a simple example in which
synthetic observation sequence is constructed having inherently many transition models

We run the sequence through our function deep_markov.m 
This is an inference function that captures non-stationarity in Markov model caused by switching transition model

For details see our cdc paper: Likelihood Rate based Estimation of Nonstationary Markov Models
